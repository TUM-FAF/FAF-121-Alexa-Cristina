## Mobile Applications Development
  - Eclipse

### Prerequisites:
  - IDEs: Eclipse
  - Languages: Java
  - Technologies and Frameworks: Android

### Mandatory Tasks:
  - Study design guidlines for any mobile OS ([Android](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html), [Windows Mobile](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/design))

  - Create a mobile app and launch it on emulator/simulator. Your app should have at least 3 element (ex. button, textarea, statusbar...) and one action (ex. clicking on a button will trigger a popup)
    These project I created taking part in competition for programming girls. It is totally developed by me and it has a lot of drawbacks besides it misses the databases. 
 
### Tasks With Points:
  - Install your application on a mobile phone. It should have somewhere your full name (on main screen, in settings...) (2pt)
    Picture:

  - Create 3 different views (ex. one with a list of some element, one with some settings and one with application description) (2pt)
    The applications has generally 3 tasks: Registration, Information and Needed Blood, Each of them opens a new activity, with different types of views.
  - Debug an application. At some point you'll have bugs (ex. null pointer exception). Set breakpoints and/or watchers. Find out buggy variables. (1pt)
    I have done this with the Log class from Java, I am sure there more methods, but this is all I used. 
  - Created several activities, even tried one using Java. (1 pt )
  - [Screen Cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCnoHaPvaZs): but I will not claim points of it because it doesn't fill all the requirements. 

##Conclusions:
  - this experience made me more familiar with Java specifically as a programiing language. 
  - also, I got better understanding about android applications and how do they work
  - I've understood the lifetime of an android application
  - and I am going to further develop myself in this area and possibly the app
